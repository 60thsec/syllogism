;;;; Syllogism solver

;; SYLLOGISM-REPL is the main function to be executed by the program.
;; It will run a small interpreter that accepts three types of sentences:
;; - Assertions, which are statements of the form [Every|All|Some] X [is|are] {not} Y.
;;   The program will add them as axioms into the state of the program.
;; - Queries, which are assertions preceded by "Is it true that".
;;   The program will try to prove them and print a proof if possible.
;; - A sentence starting with the word quit, in which case the program will quit and return its state.
;; Conditional assertions and proofs may also be added in the future, by extending the environment with hypotheticals.
